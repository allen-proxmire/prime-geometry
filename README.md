# Prime Geometry

Prime Geometry is a unified mathematical framework built from a single idea:
**every pair of consecutive primes generates a geometric object.**

From this simple construction arise:
- the PSD identity and modular last-digit laws,
- geometric gap estimators,
- the Linear Law Suite,
- Δα structure and DAZZ,
- twin-prime selector theorems,
- spectral ratio laws involving zeta zeros.

This repository contains:
- Prime Geometry I — Prime Triangles  
- Prime Geometry II — PSD + Linear Laws  
- Prime Geometry III — DAZZ (Δα geometry)  
- Prime Geometry IV — Gap-Bias Analysis  
- Prime Geometry V — Selector Theorems  
- Prime Geometry VI — Zero-Ratio Scaling Laws  

For the philosophical and mathematical foundations of the framework,
see **`MANIFESTO.md`**.

Each section includes:
- A NOTE or paper (PDF)
- Code for analysis
- Generated data
- Further directions
