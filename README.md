### Prime Geometry  
# PG01_Construction
# PG02_Findings

PG01 contains speculation and the geometric development of ideas that eventually led to PG02.

PG02 contains two documents: 

- A Scale-Normalized Curvature Invariant Distinguishing Prime Gaps from Admissible Random Sequences
- Scale-Stable Geometric and Ordering Constraints in the Prime Gap Sequence

The result establishes an empirical invariant distinguishing prime gaps from admissible randomized sequences, not a generative or predictive model.

No dynamical law is proposed; the results establish only the existence and coherence of a nontrivial structural constraint over the tested computational ranges, not a proven asymptotic law.
