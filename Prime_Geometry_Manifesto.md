# Prime Geometry Manifesto
## 1. Vision
- Why prime geometry exists
- What problems it reframes
- The central insight: primes are not 1D; they generate geometric objects

## 2. Foundations
- Prime Triangles
- C1, C2, Δα, ΔC geometry
- Integer constraints
- The linear laws and modular skeletons
- The geometry → gap → zeta connection

## 3. The Geometric Objects
- Hypotenuse pairs (C1, C2)
- Alpha angles (α, Δα)
- PSD Factors x
- Prime-Distance Laws (skip-one gaps)
- The new linearities and identities

## 4. The Big Unification
- All identities live inside a single geometric skeleton
- PSD, DAZZ, Selector Theorems, Zero-Ratio Laws
- Why the objects scale together
- Why these relationships are unexpected

## 5. The Research Program
- What Prime Geometry aims to uncover
- Predictive heuristics
- Clean experimental pipeline
- How geometry enriches prime analysis

## 6. The Six Pillars (Prime Geometry I–VI)
- I: Prime Triangles (C2–C1 and geometric gap estimators)
- II: Prime Square-Difference and the Linear Law Suite
- III: DAZZ (Δα and spectral behavior)
- IV: Gap-Bias and Skip-One Structure
- V: Selector Theorems (twin prime geometry, selectors)
- VI: Zero-Ratio Scaling Laws (prime vs. zeta-zero growth)

## 7. The Call to Inquiry
- This is not a claim to solve the big conjectures.
- It is a unified geometric perspective.
- It invites rigorous study, expansion, critique.
